      <p>Hello ! Hallo !  Bonjour ! Hola ! नमस्ते ! & হ্যালো ! This is Barunavo Pal and I'm originally from the beautiful town of Alipurduar in West Bengal, India.</p>
    
      <p>I have a strong educational background in engineering and finance. I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering and went on to pursue my passion for Microelectronics and VLSI Technology, earning an M.Tech in that field. To complement my technical skills with business acumen, I further pursued an MBA in Fintech.</p>
    
      <p>Professionally, I am a Platform DevOps Engineer, currently working at Allianz Technology SE in Munich, Germany. It's an exciting journey working in a diverse and dynamic environment, where I get to apply my technical expertise and collaborate with talented individuals.</p>
    
      <p>I now reside in the vibrant city of Berlin, Germany, where I enjoy the blend of rich history and modern culture. I live here with my wonderful wife, Sumana Saha, who has been my constant support and inspiration.</p>
    
      <p>In my free time, I have a few hobbies that I'm passionate about. I love to express my thoughts through blogging, sharing my experiences and insights on various topics. Cooking is another one of my favorite pastimes; experimenting with new recipes brings me immense joy. And whenever possible, I indulge my wanderlust by traveling to different places and exploring new cultures.</p>
    
      <p>Sports have always been an integral part of my life. I am an avid fan of both cricket and football, and I never miss an opportunity to watch the matches and cheer for my favorite teams. Apart from being a spectator, I also enjoy playing badminton, which helps me stay active and fit.</p>
    
      <p>Thank you for visiting my personal website. Feel free to connect with me through my social media channels or drop me an email. I'm always open to meeting new people and exchanging ideas!</p>
