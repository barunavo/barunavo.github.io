            <p>
              In the vast tapestry of life, I am a <strong>Bengali hailing from Alipurduar</strong>, nestled in the 
              captivating state of West Bengal, India. While I navigate the winding streets of this European metropolis, 
              my heart remains intertwined with the vivid hues of my Indian heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              This dual identity is my strength. I bring an Eastern philosophical approach to Western pragmatism, 
              creating a unique perspective in problem-solving and life itself. I've learned that you don't have to 
              choose between cultures—you can be a synthesis of both, carrying your roots while growing new branches.

              My story is an amalgamation of diverse flavors, cultures, and intellectual pursuits. I strive to blend 
              the spices of life, savoring each moment as I embark on this remarkable journey through the intricate 
              tapestry of existence. From the serene landscapes of West Bengal to the bustling tech hubs of Europe, 
              from microelectronics to cloud infrastructure, from curry to currywurst—every experience has shaped who I am today.

            <p style="color: rgba(255,255,255,0.95); font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.9;">
              I believe in continuous learning, authentic connections, and the power of technology to solve meaningful 
              problems. Whether it's optimizing a Kubernetes cluster or cooking a perfect biryani, I approach everything 
              with curiosity, dedication, and a dash of humor.
