      <h2>How We Started Learning German After Coming to Germany</h2>
      <br />
      <p>Stepping foot on foreign soil often brings with it a series of challenges and adventures. Our journey began on the 6th of October 2017 when we arrived in the quaint town of Essen, nestled in the heart of North Rhein Westphalia, Germany. Little did we know that our time here would be enriched not only by work but also by the quest to learn the local language‚ÄîGerman.</p>
      <li>Embracing the Challenge:</li>
      <p>As we settled into our new surroundings, we quickly realized that most of the people in Essen spoke German. Without a grasp of the language, daily life became an uphill battle. Determined to conquer this obstacle, we embarked on a search for language learning options.</p>
      <li>Finding the Solution:</li>
      <p>After researching various avenues, we discovered Volkshochschule Essen‚Äîa renowned institution offering intensive German language courses. Excitement filled our hearts as we applied for admission, eager to commence our language journey.</p>
      <li>Balancing Work and Study:</li>
      <p>Being working professionals, we faced the challenge of managing our schedules effectively. Our German language courses were scheduled after office hours, with classes beginning at 5:30 pm CET/CEST. During the summer months, attending classes was manageable, but as winter set in, it became more arduous.</p>
      <li>A Day of Juggling:</li>
      <p>Each day presented a demanding routine. We would start our day at 7 am, commuting to Dortmund, Germany, where our offices were located. After a long day's work, we would leave the office at 4:15 pm, rushing to make it to our language classes by 5:15 pm. The logistical challenges were numerous, but our determination pushed us forward.</p>
      <li>Supportive Colleagues:</li>
      <p>The silver lining in our journey was the unwavering support of our office colleagues. Understanding the significance of learning German, they encouraged and stood by us throughout our language learning odyssey. Their assistance made our path smoother, and their encouragement fueled our motivation.</p>
      <li>A Journey of Persistence:</li>
      <p>For a year and a half, we relentlessly pursued our goal, attending German language classes three days a week. Balancing work, studies, and daily chores became our way of life. We would even cook for the next day after our classes, utilizing every moment to its fullest.</p>
      <li>Triumph and Validation:</li>
      <p>Finally, our hard work paid off. With unwavering determination, we successfully passed the B1 German language course on our first attempt. The feeling of accomplishment and the validation of our efforts filled our hearts with pride.</p>
      <li>Conclusion:</li>
      <p>Our journey of learning German in Germany was not just about mastering a language; it was about embracing a new culture, building connections, and carving our place in a foreign land. Through dedication, perseverance, and the support of our colleagues, we conquered the language barrier, opening doors to endless opportunities. Our experience serves as a testament to the fact that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle, empowering us to thrive in our chosen endeavors.</p>
