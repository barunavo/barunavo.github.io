              Family is a special and essential part of our lives. It serves as a source of love, support, and happiness. 
              Throughout my personal and professional journey, I've come to deeply appreciate how family shapes who we become 
              and provides the foundation for our achievements.

              Let me share some reflections on the remarkable individuals who have influenced my life and career.

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2rem;">My Father - The Academic</h3>
            <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
              <img src="../images/baba.jpg" alt="Father" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            </div>
            <p>
              My father is a retired educator with a Ph.D. in Child Psychology and an M.Sc. in Mathematics. His career in 
              teaching has been a source of inspiration throughout my life. Even in retirement, he continues to guide me with 
              his wisdom and insights gained from decades of working with students and understanding human development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond his academic achievements, he has a passion for gardening and has been the cornerstone of our household. 
              He built our family home in West Bengal, India—a place that remains a constant connection to my roots despite 
              living thousands of miles away in Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Life Lessons:</strong> The importance of continuous learning, patience in teaching others, and the 
              value of building something lasting for future generations.

            <h3 style="color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2rem;">My Mother - The Nurturer</h3>
            <div style="margin: 2rem 0; text-align: center;">
              <img src="../images/maa.jpg" alt="Mother" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            </div>
            <p>
              My mother was a Bengali Language Teacher who made the significant decision to focus on our family's well-being 
              early in my life. Her dedication to creating a nurturing home environment has been instrumental in providing the 
              stability that allowed me to pursue ambitious educational and career goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              She finds joy in literature, music (particularly Rabindra Sangeet), and cooking traditional Bengali cuisine. 
              Her love for culture and tradition has instilled in me a deep appreciation for my heritage—something that 
              remains important even as I build my life in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Life Lessons:</strong> The power of sacrifice, the importance of cultural roots, and how nurturing 
              environments create opportunities for others to thrive.

              <img src="../images/kuttu.jpg" alt="Partner" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 10px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            </div>
            <p>
              My wife and I met during our professional careers in India and got married in 2017. Like me, she is a software 
              engineer with an M.Tech in Software Engineering, which creates a unique understanding between us about the 
              challenges and rewards of working in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              We've built our life together in Berlin, Germany, navigating the adventures and challenges of living in a 
              foreign country as a team. Her support has been invaluable throughout my career transitions and educational 
              pursuits, and she brings creativity and perspective to our shared journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond her professional capabilities, she has diverse interests in art, craft, and design, which adds richness 
              to our life together. Our partnership is built on mutual respect, shared goals, and unconditional support.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Key Life Lessons:</strong> The importance of partnership, mutual support in professional growth, and 
              how shared experiences strengthen bonds.

            <h2 class="resume-heading" style="margin-top: 3rem;">Reflections on Family and Success</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
              Having a supportive and loving family has been fundamental to my personal and professional development. They 
              are the foundation that allows me to take calculated risks, pursue ambitious goals, and navigate the challenges 
              of building a career in a foreign country.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
              Family is not just about blood relations—it's about the connections, love, and support we share. It's a 
              constant source of inspiration, encouragement, and happiness. Whether celebrating successes or providing comfort 
              during challenging times, family remains the anchor that keeps us grounded.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.8;">
              As I continue my journey in the tech industry and beyond, I'm incredibly grateful for the wonderful family that 
              has shaped who I am and continues to be a source of strength and motivation.
            </p>
